  This paper presents a proposal for development of work proposed by (REIS, 2013), and for this, will be developed a specification of a free and open source format with the goal of providing support for marking content for audiobooks. An Editor is developed in which will be responsible for encode and decode the metadata of a file type Ogg Vorbis and insert a new package containing the markings content. This proposal was built on the specifications of Ogg Vorbis and libraries provided by the foundation Xiph.org.
